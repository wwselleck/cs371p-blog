The Eagles lost and the Longhorns lost and I'm sad.

I sucked it up this time and posted on Piazza to find a partner for the final project. After about 4 hours of work on Saturday, I think I can pretty confidently say that this project will not be nearly as difficult as Darwin was. The main difference between the two that makes this one so much easier, I think, is that cells are only concerned with themselves and will only ever make changes to themselves (at least for our implementation). The only change a cell will ever make is to either stay alive, stay dead, become alive, or die (RIP). Everything concerning the cell's surroundings is done in Life and told to the cell, unlike Darwin where the Creature's had to some way perform actions on other Creatures. I don't have much else to say on the project yet, will update next week with the part where it gets way harder than I thought and I end up crying and watching [reviews of boxed macaroni and cheese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsWF91GhOik) in my room with the lights off.


### Tippy Pebbles

After a web development packed summer, I've barely done any this semester. To try and get a bit back into it this weekend, I tried to deploy a simple Node application onto DigitalOcean, and along the way collected a bunch of DevOpsy articles that may be of interest to some people. 

[How to configure a linux service](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-a-linux-service-to-start-automatically-after-a-crash-or-reboot-part-1-practical-examples)

[Nginx Beginner's Guide](http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html)

Also, in case any of you just glossed over that link up there^, I was not kidding about the reviews of boxed macaroni and cheese. [These guys](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmqeFKoBmT0I_glrgD5zC8NEXgTQ_-Jx_) upload a new one about once a week and they are surpringly very entertaining. Would recommend to friends and family alike.
