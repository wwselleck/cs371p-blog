The Mets are about to lose the world series and it makes me sad.

I decided to work on this project alone because I was going to be pretty busy for those two weeks and wanted to be able to work on it on my own schedule. Also I think I've run out of people I know in this class. About 15 or so hours in and I can pretty confidently say that this project is significantly harder than the previous three. It's entirely possible that I'm just making it harder than it needs to be, but even if that's the case I think it'd be the most difficult project by far. I'm not sure if that makes me happier or not about my decision to work on this alone. I'm certainly able to get the work done at a faster rate since I'm working alone, but I'm also putting a lot more work on myself. I think overall I'm happy with my decision, but am definitley going to have very little free time for the next 4 days. 

For all the critique I've given for this class in these blog posts about how un-object-oriented Object-Oriented Programming is, this project is making up for a lot of it. I feel like the restriction on not being allowed to use getters and setters is really making me think about OOP in a way I haven't had to before, and the C++-ness of it (specifically the use of references and pointers) is really adding to how much I'm learning.
