My 3 favorite things that can possibly happen on a Sunday 

1) Eagles win
2) Cowboys lose
3) Patriots lose

and the only reason all 3 didn't happen today is because the Cowboys play on Monday..... :).

It's been pretty well documented over the past few months what I think about this class. I feel like I've learned a ton, but not necessarily a
ton about object-oriented programming. If I had come into this class hoping to learn about the specifics of OOP in C++ I would say this was the best
class I've had at UT. I'm still pretty happy that I decided to take it because, despite not being as OOPy as I was hoping, I definitely learned
a lot of valuable stuff.

As for the final exam, I thought it was pretty interesting and fair, but strangely left off a ton of material from the second half of the course.
Unless I just reallllllllly screwed it up, there wasn't anything about virtual functions, inheritance, reflection (pretty much), or handle.
Not that I'm really complaining, those were probably the more difficult parts of class, but it seemed weird to have them completely absent from the exam.
Again, maybe I really screwed it up and this blog post will end up being pretty embarassing. In fact, the fact that none of those topics
were on the exam has convinced me in the past few minutes that I just really screwed it up. 

### Tippy Clause is coming to town
Smile at strangers you pass while you're walking, it'll make their day better. But don't do it too much, that's creepy. Also, learn web development
and then message me on Facebook, I need more people to talk to about it. Plus it's super cool. Deuces, homies.
