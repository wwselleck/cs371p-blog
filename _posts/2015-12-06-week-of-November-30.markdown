My 3 favorite things that can possibly happen on a Sunday 

1) Eagles win
2) Cowboys lose
3) Patriots lose

and the only reason all 3 didn't happen today is because the Cowboys play on Monday..... :).

It's been pretty well documented over the past few months what I think about this class. I feel like I've learned a ton, but not necessarily a
ton about object-oriented programming. If I had come into this class hoping to learn about the specifics of OOP in C++ I would say this was the best
class I've had at UT. I'm still pretty happy that I decided to take it because, despite not being as OOPy as I was hoping, I definitely learned
a lot of valuable stuff.

I'm also not a huge fan of the focus the class puts on "industry". I put industry in quotations because a lot of the focus on real-life-job-topics is done in a way that, if actually done at an actual real life job, would be pretty ridiculous. Like, for example, having an issues quota. I'd love to see the company that requires their programmers submit a certain number of issues for a story they're working on. I could *maybe* see the logic in this for the first project so people can get used to using the issue tracker, but even then the issue tracker is a pretty simple tool that anyone who is smart enough to get into UT can figure out in a couple of minutes. The TravisCI part of the class would have made more sense to me if we were required to read the documentation for a Travis file and had to write our own, but all that was really required was chaning a couple "Collatz"'s to "Darwin's" and going along your merry way. But I had experience with most of the tools used in the class beforehand, so maybe what seems annoying to me is actually useful to someone else. 

As for the final exam, I thought it was pretty interesting and fair, but strangely left off a ton of material from the second half of the course.
Unless I just reallllllllly screwed it up, there wasn't anything about [redacted in case I wasn't supposed to talk about the specifics of the exam yet].
Not that I'm really complaining, those were probably the more difficult parts of class, but it seemed weird to have them completely absent from the exam.
Again, maybe I really screwed it up and this blog post will end up being pretty embarassing. In fact, the fact that none of those topics
were on the exam has convinced me in the past few minutes that I just really screwed it up.

### Tippy Clause is coming to town
Smile at strangers you pass while you're walking, it'll make their day better. But don't do it too much, that's creepy. Also, learn web development
and then message me on Facebook, I need more people to talk to about it. Plus it's super cool. Deuces, homies.
