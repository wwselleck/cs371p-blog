Eagles are 7-7 against the Cowboys right now, but I've come to accept that they suck and will continue to suck for the rest of the year.

When I first read the project 4 description I thought it was pretty straightforward and would only take 10-15 hours. Heh...no. My timings came out to about 26 hours, but I'm pretty sure it was closer to 30. I think the most time consuming part for me was second-guessing myself on the design, and then refactoring when I decided to make a change. I think in the end I came out with an at least decently designed project, but it took a very long time to get there. Other than refactoring when I wanted to make a design change, the most time consuming part was definitely writing unit tests. I think I ended up with over 1300 lines of unit tests, which had pretty good coverage but once again took many an hour to get there. 

Even though the project took over my life the past week, I have to say that it was one of the most rewarding things I've done at UT, learning wise. The restriction on not using getters and setters made me think about the design in ways that I've never had to before. Along with that, I learned quite a bit more C++ along the way having to try new things to avoid getters and setters. 26 hours well spent, I would say.

If you're into web development, consider [contributing to MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Getting_started). There are a lot of tasks big and small that need to get done, and it's probably a cool thing to talk to recruiters about and shows that you have a real interest in it. Or not, I don't know I'm not a recruiter. But it couldn't hurt. :D.
