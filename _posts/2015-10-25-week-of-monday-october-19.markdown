The Eagles are currenty losing, but I still have faith. 

Project 3 was due on Thursday, and honestly it was pretty straight forward. The hardest part was wrapping my head around the actual problem, which I guess I made harder on myself by not missing class two Mondays ago. Once my partner and I understood that sentinels contain the number of free bytes and not the number of free ints, and how some of edge cases were handled, the problem didn't take too long to solve. 

Once again this project had fairly little to do with object-oriented programming, and a lot do with with C++ specific things. Although Project 4 appears to allow a bit more object-oriented design than the first 3 projects, I've come to accept that this course will be, more or less, a C++ course that also somewhat teaches OOP through in a very C++ specific way. At the beginning of the semester I looked through the course schedule and saw topics like Dependency Inversion, Single Responsibility, and Getters and Setters listed and was pretty excited to be formally taught about these things. So far these topics have been mostly absent, aside from the assigned readings. I'm happy to have become at least somewhat competent in C++ through this course, but kind of wish the more object-oriented topics had more of a presence. That's probably the last thing I'll say on this subject as I've talked about it once or twice before.

### Tip Duncan
Programming wise, I mostly just worked on my [reddit bot](https://github.com/wwselleck/StatOtter) this week. I'm pretty new to Python so there's nothing overly interesting to talk about on that, other that making a reddit bot in Python has been extremely easier than making in Javascript since I don't have to deal with all the asnycyness of Javascript that wouldn't have been very benefitial for this project anyway. I guess that's a tip, if you're going to write a reddit bot (or I guess any linear programming running in an infinite loop that required a lot of HTTP requests), write it in not-Javascript.
