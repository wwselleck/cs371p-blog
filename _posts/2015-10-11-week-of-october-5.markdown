THE EAGLES DESTROYED. RIP SAINTS. WE SUPER BOWL NOW.

We had a test this week. It was decently difficult. I think I did pretty good. Or. I mean. At least decently. I hope I wrote dark enough. The test was pretty unlike any CS test I've taken so far, and I think for the better. The iterator implementation question in particular was very interesting since it made you think about something whose "iteration" was something more complex than just incrementing by one. The only qualm I may have had with the test was a weird restriction the second to last question had, but I'm afraid to say anything more specific than that since I'm not sure if we're allowed to talk about the specifics of the exam yet. Overall, though, the test was very fair.

This was a pretty uneventful week otherwise; I can't even really remember what we did in class. I think one day was about `Const` and the other about Arrays, but if I remember correctly we spent a lot of time on other stuff like the quiz both days. I'll have more to talk about class-wise this week I'm sure since Project 3 got released. 

### Hot n Spicy Cheeze Tips
After becoming at least decently proficient in Javascript this summer, I wanted to shift focus to a language that's used more generally. _Yes I know that Javascript can be used outside of web dev now with Node, but it doesn't have nearly the support as other general languages._ I decided on Python for the same reasons everyone else does, it's the most heaily used very high level language, and I prefer the programming style of Python to Ruby after learning a decent amount of Ruby. The book I'm reading is [Dive Into Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/), and so far I think it's been pretty good.

Have a splennnndid week :D
